### 📈 **Evaluation Metrics** - COMPLETE
**Requirement**: Track happiness, diversity, emergence, efficiency

✅ **Metrics Implementation**:

1. **Average Happiness** (Global well-being)
   - Tracks agent satisfaction over time
   - Combines all need fulfillment
   - Shows trends and ranges

2. **Decision Diversity** 
   - Shannon entropy of action distribution
   - Measures behavioral variety across agents
   - Prevents monotonous behavior

3. **Computational Efficiency**
   - FPS tracking and optimization

### 🎯 **Example Cycle** - WORKING
**Requirement**: Realistic daily routines

✅ **Observed Behavior Patterns**:
```
[Morning 8 AM] Agent wakes → checks hunger → goes to café
→ spends money, gains happiness → goes to office (work hours)
→ earns money, loses energy → socializes in park
→ returns home → sleeps, resets energy
```

✅ **Adaptive Learning**:
- Agents learn optimal eating times
- Work-life balance emerges naturally  
- Social patterns develop based on personality
- Money management strategies evolve
